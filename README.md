## About
Often times, good tools written by good programmers aren't pretty. That's why I, as a bad programmer, chose one of the main goals to make the manager looks nice and only later functional. Therefore, you may encounter a lot of bugs.


## Compilation
Use Visual Studio 2022 and invoke the .sln.
